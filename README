This is a simple interface to http://www.rafb.net/ which need vim's python interface as a dependency. Edit a file, then issue the command 
:Paste 
and it will post the whole file on rafb. The link will come in your clipboard(* and +) as default, so you can post it with Ctrl + v or middle mouse button somewhere on IRC, browsers, etc. I also have that map in my ~/.vimrc
vnoremap <leader>paste y:call Paste('<C-R>"')<cr><cr>
with which you can paste just a snippet from the file. Just select the block/text in VISUAL mode and hit <leader>paste this will copy the text to the site, note <leader> is \ as default in vim.
